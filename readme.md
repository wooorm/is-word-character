## What is this?

This is a function that checks if a given character is a word character:
whether it matches `\w` (which is short for `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).

## When should I use this?

Not often, as itâ€™s relatively simple to do yourself.
This package exists because itâ€™s needed in several related packages, at which
point it becomes useful to defer to one shared function.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install is-word-character
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {isWordCharacter} from 'https://esm.sh/is-word-character@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {isWordCharacter} from 'https://esm.sh/is-word-character@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {isWordCharacter} from 'is-word-character'

isWordCharacter('a') // => true
isWordCharacter('Z') // => true
isWordCharacter('0') // => true
isWordCharacter('_') // => true
isWordCharacter(' ') // => false
isWordCharacter('ðŸ’©') // => false
```

## API

This package exports the following identifier: `isWordCharacter`.
There is no default export.

### `isWordCharacter(character|code)`

Check whether the given character code (`number`), or the character code at the
first position (`string`), is a word character.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
It also works in Deno and modern browsers.

## Security

This package is safe.
